This blog post about my `.vimrc` settings is mainly for personal reference, but I thought I'd make it public in case anyone else was interested. I plan on keeping this post updated if I ever change my `.vimrc` configuration.

Some helpful websites that I've found are listed here:

- basic Vim settings
  - [A Good Vimrc](https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html)
  - [Stanford CS 107 vimrc](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/resources/sample_vimrc)
  - [GitHub: simonista/.vimrc](https://gist.github.com/simonista/8703722)
- Vim colorschemes
  - [GitHub: flazz/vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes)

"""" Basic Behaviour

set number              " show line numbers
set wrap                " wrap lines
set encoding=utf-8      " set encoding to UTF-8 (default was "latin1")
set mouse=a             " enable mouse support (might not work well on Mac OS X)
set wildmenu            " visual autocomplete for command menu
set lazyredraw          " redraw screen only when we need to
set showmatch           " highlight matching parentheses / brackets [{()}]
set laststatus=2        " always show statusline (even with only single window)
set ruler               " show line and column number of the cursor on right side of statusline
set visualbell          " blink cursor on error, instead of beeping


"""" Key Bindings

" move vertically by visual line (don't skip wrapped lines)
nmap j gj
nmap k gk


"""" Vim Appearance

" put colorscheme files in ~/.vim/colors/
colorscheme murphy      " good colorschemes: murphy, slate, molokai, badwolf, solarized

" Use filetype-based syntax hilighting, ftplugins, and indentation.
syntax enable
filetype plugin indent on


"""" Tab settings

set tabstop=4           " number of spaces per <TAB>
set expandtab           " convert <TAB> key-presses to spaces
set shiftwidth=4        " set a <TAB> key-press equal to 4 spaces

set autoindent          " copy indent from current line when starting a new line
set smartindent         " even better autoindent (e.g. add indent after '{')


"""" Search settings

set incsearch           " search as characters are entered
set hlsearch            " highlight matches

" turn off seach hilighting with <CR> (carriage-return)
nnoremap <CR> :nohlsearch<CR><CR>


"""" Miscellaneous settings that might be worth enabling

"set cursorline         " highlight current line
"set background=dark    " configure Vim to use brighter colors
"set autoread           " autoreload the file in Vim if it has been changed outside of Vim
```
