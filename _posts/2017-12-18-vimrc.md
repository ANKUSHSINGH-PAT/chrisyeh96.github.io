This blog post about my `.vimrc` settings is mainly for personal reference, but I thought I'd make it public in case anyone else was interested. I plan on keeping this post updated if I ever change my `.vimrc` configuration.

Some helpful websites that I've found are listed here:

- basic Vim settings
  - [A Good Vimrc](https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html)
  - [Stanford CS 107 vimrc](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/resources/sample_vimrc)
  - [GitHub: simonista/.vimrc](https://gist.github.com/simonista/8703722)
- Vim colorschemes
  - put colorscheme files in `~/.vim/colors/`
  - [GitHub: flazz/vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes)

My `.vimrc` file is also hosted as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisyeh96/5d4479dee77e4b04786e9bc71f43967c).
